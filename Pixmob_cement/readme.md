this is a library to control the PixMob batches:

 - you need to have the SmartRC-CC1101-Driver-Lib from Little Satan installed - only this CC1101 lib is able to switch the transceiver into transparent mode.
 - for wiring have a look to the [wiki](https://github.com/sueppchen/PixMob_waveband/wiki)
 - enjoy
